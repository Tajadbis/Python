with open("Example1,"r") as File1:
print("Firstline:" File1.readline())

#Iterate through the lines 
With open("Example:",r) as File1
i=0
for line in File1: 
print("Iteration"str(i),":",line)
i=i+1
Easier way,
with open('example:","r") as File
Filelist=File1.readline()
#Each is the corresponding line of the file from line(0) as first
Filelist(0) 
Filelist(1)
